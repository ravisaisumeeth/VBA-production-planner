# 🚬 Tobacco Production Planner – Excel VBA Automation

**An automated Excel-based planning tool for raw material and production scheduling in tobacco manufacturing**

---

## 📦 Project Overview

This Excel-based **Production Planner** is built specifically for **tobacco manufacturers**, helping streamline raw material planning, scheduling, and inventory management using **VBA and macros**. The tool helps ensure product availability while maintaining optimal Days of Supply (DOS) and staying ahead of inventory shortages.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📅 Automate daily and weekly production planning  
- 📉 Monitor raw material consumption and update availability  
- ⚠️ Alert planners when inventory falls below threshold  
- ⏱️ Maintain **Min/Max DOS targets** for each SKU  
- 📋 Generate easy-to-read reports and summaries for operations
